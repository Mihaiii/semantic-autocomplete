The primary goal is to capture the semantic meaning of words so that words with similar meanings are located close to each other in this space. This is achieved by transforming sparse, high-dimensional word vectors into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving semantic relationships.",

        "label": "Embeddings are used because they provide a dense and efficient representation of words, capturing complex patterns in language that are not apparent at the surface level. Unlike one-hot encoding, which treats words as isolated units without any notion of similarity, embeddings map words into a vector space based on their usage and context. This allows models to understand synonyms, analogies, and the overall semantics of text, leading to more nuanced and intelligent processing.",

These models apply algorithms to adjust the position of each word in the vector space, such that the distance between vectors captures semantic relationships between words. For example, similar words are placed closer together, whereas unrelated words are positioned farther apart.",

This requires careful consideration and mitigation strategies during model development and deployment. Additionally, creating and fine-tuning embeddings for specific domains or languages with limited resources can be challenging, necessitating innovative approaches to leverage embeddings effectively across diverse contexts.",

This means that words with multiple meanings are represented by the same vector across different uses. Contextual embeddings, introduced by models such as BERT and ELMo, represent words as vectors that vary depending on the word's context within a sentence. This allows these models to capture the nuances of language more effectively, distinguishing between different meanings of a word based on its usage.",

For example, embeddings can reflect syntactic categories like part of speech, and models trained on sentence-level tasks can learn representations that implicitly encode grammatical structures. However, explicit modeling of syntax and grammar often requires architectures designed specifically for these aspects, such as syntactic parsing models.",
